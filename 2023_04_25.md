> 10th grade students at my school will be conducting an interview to transition to 11th grade. They will be following these instructions "Job Description Latitude High eleventh grade candidates should be prepared for an academically and personally challenging setting. According to college admissions, academic performance in the eleventh grade is weighed most heavily for entrance. Students entering the junior year at Latitude should be prepared to take on a foreign language course on top of their 3 core academic classes which adds to students’ workload. In addition to this increase in academic responsibility, candidates will also take on more extracurricular activities. During this year, students will represent Latitude by actively participating in a professional setting through the month-long internship program. These candidates should also be prepared to manage the tasks of preparing for SAT’s, researching colleges of interest, and applying for scholarships. Position Qualifications: Ability to balance three classes, foreign language, and an internship Ability to complete beautiful work that demonstrates refinement and pride Comfort presenting evidence of learning to a variety of audiences Ability to represent Latitude both on campus and in the community, through volunteering, leadership, and good citizenship Ability to self-advocate and work independently or collaborate in groups to complete work in an effective, efficient manner Ability to genuinely assess one’s strengths, weaknesses, and growth as a learner Requirements for Application: In order to receive an interview, candidates must submit a cover letter and resume Interviews will take place on Wednesday June 1st and Thursday June 2nd Applicants are expected to dress professionally and to arrive on time, prepared with a cover letter and resume (8 printed copies of each) Format and expectations for interview: Student steps out, resume passed out to panel. (Panel has 2 minutes to review) Student walks in dressed in professional business attire (check with teacher), shake everyones hand in the panel (5min) Student passes out their Cover Letter (2 paragraphs to a complete page), and the first question is “Tell us about yourself.” You will then read the Cover Letter out loud to the panel.

(10 min) To conclude the interview, the interviewee will thank the panel, shake panelists hands, and leave the room for the panelists to discuss the interview. The student will return to receive feedback. (5 min)" We already have a list of questions, included here: "Tell us about your 10th grade experience. Tell us about a time when you were proud of yourself this year. Tell us about a time when you were assertive in a group. Tell us about a time when you put another person's learning needs before your own. Tell us about a time when you had to overcome a challenge. Tell us about a time when you took leadership in a group. Tell us about a time when you grew in one of the Latitude competencies. Tell us about a time when you demonstrated proficiency at \[pick a skill from resume\]. Tell us about a time when you had to correct an error or mistake you made. Tell us about a time when you had to come to a compromise with a group (either in ideas, direction, or pacing of the group) …you had to speed up/slow down to accommodate group members …you had to change course in a project …you had to change the way you thought about a task/project What is a skill you have continued to struggle with despite efforts to overcome these difficulties? What have you already tried to overcome this, and what were the results? Since you will have more independent responsibilities next year (e.g., internship, foreign-language requirement), how do we know that you are ready to manage your own time to have success? What are you most hoping to improve in next year and why? What is your biggest area for growth next year, and why? What is your biggest weakness and how can you overcome it?" Your task is to serve as my teaching assistant to build scaffolding to help students develop a resume. I want a lesson plan that leverages the student's answers to the questions above to help them first brainstorm ideas for what goes on the resume, then write a great resume with active language to describe their accomplishments. This resume will be used the following year in their applications for internships.

> For the rest of your lessons that you generate, please begin with a 5-15 minute section to kickoff the lesson called a "Do Now." A "Do Now" allows students work silently for the beginning of class to activate knowledge. For example, for this lesson, I would design a do now like this: "Do Now: Students will begin with five minutes to review a resume. First, they will be asked to annotate the resume with the following instructions: - Circle any role you see on the resume; - Underline any active verbs you find in descriptions: - Examples: managed, initiated, founded, built, engineered, published - Non-examples: was, did, had - Box any skills or technologies the resume references Then, they will answer the following questions: 1. What experience stands out to you and most? Cite one quotation from the resume that made the experience pop. 2. What experience from your year do you think will stand out the most on your resume?" Similarly, lessons should close with a quick exit ticket that students can answer that should conclude the lesson. It can be one question, like "list three sections of a resume?" or something to promote metacognition like "what was an idea you generated today that you learned from the lesson?" Please give me an example of a different do now and exit ticket for this first lesson plan.
